6.3 (2012-07-10)
================

Bugfixes
--------

- Get all the scores in qualities and ambiguous in bin/parse_fastqc.RNAseq.pl

- Fix parsing of reads in bin/run_gem2sam.RNAseq.pl 

- Find libraries correctly in bin/parse_fastqc.RNAseq.pl

- Handle HiSEq read IDs correctly in bin/build_inclusion_dist.RNAseq.pl

Internal
--------

- In template3.0.txt, remove unpooled transcript quantification

- In template3.0.txt, remove the need for the unpooled inclusion

- In bin/build_inclusion_dist.RNAseq.pl, remove the need for the unpooled inclusion

- In template.bam.txt, remove the non pooled transcript expression levels

6.2 (2012-07-06)
================

- FastQC is now used to calculate the read stats

- In the _read_stats rule, use build_read_stats.fastqc.RNAseq.pl instead of 
  build_read_stats.RNAseq.pl

- Add parse_fastqc.RNAseq.pl to the _read_stats rule

- Add bin/get_feature_RPKM_gtf.RNAseq.pl for creating a gtf file with the requested
  features (genes, transcripts or exons), adding the RPKM values to them.

6.1 (2012-06-27)
================

- Installation is now done using grape.buildout exclusively.

- Calculate gene and exon RPKM now from the Flux Capacitor results.
  The implementation of the rules _exon_RPKM_pooled and _gene_RPKM_pooled 
  have been changed, and the old rules have been deprecated by adding a
  postfix '_old'.
  
- Add bin/build_read_stats.fastqc.RNAseq.pl that will take as an input
  a list of fasta, fastq or bam files and it will output a summary of
  the read statistics in the file calculated by fastqc

- Add a rule for getting novel transcripts: _novel_transcripts
  This runs cufflinks the following new scripts:

  - bin/run_cufflinks.RNAseq.pl - will run cufflinks on the 
    merged SAM files with the most basic settings

  - bin/build_novel_transcripts.RNAseq.pl - will take the output
    of cufflinks and create a table to load in the database with this
    information

- Add lib/Tools/FastQC.pm for running FastQC, A quality control tool 
  for high throughput sequence data.

- Add lib/Tools/Cluster.pm containing subroutines used for submitting 
  jobs to the cluster

- Bugfix to prevent error when checking for the prerequisite flux executable

- Fix error in some tables when processing only one file of single end reads

- RPKM pooled is calculated from the flux output

6.0 (2012-04-27)
================

- Require only one gene in bin/compare_individual_genes.RNAseqComp.pl

- Fix bug occurring when no exons are detected

- Allow the comparison scripts to one with 1 dataset instead of requiring 2

- Count "." as an N in case the reads have not been preprocessed correctly

- Prevent the pipeline fom dying if no transcripts are detected

- Avoid counting the trimmed reads that map to more than 10 locations when 
  generating the mapping statistics

- Fix projections for genes with repeated exons in 
  bin/build_gene_projections.RNAseq.pl

- Skip recursive mapping if final file is already present

- Take the information for the exon overlap total from the bam file

- Allow for no transcripts and no genes to be detected without crashing

- use the bam for the exon overlaps

- Get the overlaps from the BAM when starting from bam files

- Get the overlaps from the BAM file in fastq

- Prevent the crashing of the pipeline when no read is mapped to the genome

- Add mapper memory in configuration to bin/run_mapper_cluster.RNAseq.pl

- Add bin/get_proj_overlaps_cluster2.RNAseq.pl

- Modify the overlap.total calculation in order to reduce time by using the
  information from the BAM directly instead of the overlap

- Add fluxmem option

- Add bin/link_sam.RNAseq.pl

- Add missing script bin/get_split_coverage_bam.RNAseq.pl

- Add timing for the total pipeline and each of the steps

- Remove the unpooled gene RPKM and use the pooled gene RPKM for the fusion
  transcript rule.

- Remove the reference file name from the gtf to reduce the size in 
  lib/RNAseq_pipeline_settings3.pm

- Add a check for the creation of the junctions table. Remove redundant code
  and remove the exon RPKM (unpooled) step

- Remove the file nme from the gtf in order to reduce file sizes in
  lib/RNAseq_pipeline3.pm

- Change cluster run for overlap 

- Add autoflush to the logs in lib/RNAseq_pipeline3.pm

- Reduce code by removing the read.list generation, as this is done by buildout

- Add some additional checks to bin/prepare_files.RNAseq.pl and change the way
  the log file is managed in order to time the script

- Execute script will show the wall clock time for each of teh steps executed as well as the total.

- Exon RPKM and Gene RPKM are no longer calculated for the individual lanes.

- Fix problem with the projection generation that missed some genes containing exons that are present in more than one gene. This affects > 1% of the genes

5.0.1 (2012-03-26)
==================

- add ./bin/contrib/ to host contributions from other developers

- add ./bin/run_cluster_flux.main.pl
      ./bin/run_mapper_cluster.main.pl
      ./bin/contrib/templates/template3.0.1.txt
  with specific options for 'main' cluster queue that do not work on the standard 'mem_6' queue
  
5.0 (2012-03-22)
================

- First official release

1.4.0 (2011-01-04)
==================

- Start script has a -clean option that removes all information from an experiment
  from the databases

- Quality type has to be provided to the start script in order to correctly run the
  pipeline. This has two options 'phred 'or 'solexa'
