# To do:
Modify the tables used by the common database so we have a set of different ones. 

These will be:

    * genome

    * annotation

as main tables and 

* Genome files

* Transcriptome files

* Junction files

* mappability

* exclusion files

as file pointers

And finally those that point to tables will be:

* annotation_tables
